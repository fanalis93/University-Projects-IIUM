Covid-19 vaccine panel chief urges Malaysians not to panic over Norwegian deaths before links proven.

Summary: 
When asked how safe the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is for Malaysian use, Dr Kalaiarasu said he would be taking the vaccine himself and asserted that regulatory agencies around the world, including Malaysia’s National Regulatory Pharmaceutical Agency (NPRA), have deemed it safe.  KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 — The chairman of the Vaccine Selection Technical Working Group (TWG) today said Malaysians should not avoid being vaccinated against Covid-19 based solely on reported deaths among elderly recipients in Norway. Dr Kalaiarasu, who is also the director of the Institute for Clinical Research Malaysia, additionally pointed out that adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine are occurring at a much lower rate than death caused by the disease. On January 6, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are occurring at a rate of 11.1 per one million vaccinations. Pfizer conducted its trials on over 40,000 people with ages ranging from 16 years to 80 years, and we can accept the effectiveness of the vaccine, because it has a 95 per cent efficacy.
